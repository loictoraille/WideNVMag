# Widefield_NV_Matlab
Matlab interface code to acquire and treat widefield NV centers data.

Use Matlab R2022a for the best compatibility (crucial if you use the piezo functionalities).

Prerequisites vary depending on the camera you use (more on this later).

Start in main folder, and execute either AcqESR or OpenESR (more on the other scripts later).

When updating your version, navigate to Widefield_NV_Matlab/Subfolders, copy your own Param subfolder. Then download the new version and replace the Param subfolder with your own.
