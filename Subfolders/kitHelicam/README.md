# Helicam test code for basic function

The goal fo this part is to set up atomic function on the helicam such as :
- init the camera
- set up the trigger mode (synch with internale other external oscillator)
- set up the internale oscillator frequency
- set up ROI
- set up obturation time
- ...

The goal is to be able to run the entire experiment with simple call to function, that would make it easier to interface with the any other software.
